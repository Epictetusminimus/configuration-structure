\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

It is generally useful for software to be able to programmatically determine
the capabilities of the hardware it is running on. External debuggers need to
know the same information. RISC-V extensions mostly use CSRs for this
information, but that is not flexible enough for some kinds of data like
hardware breakpoint capabilities, and cache hierarchy.

This document specifies syntax, semantics, discovery method, and access method
for a static data structure that can accommodate implementation parameters of
RISC-V standards beyond what can be easily put into CSRs. The structure is
called a Configuration Structure (CS).

\section{Goals}

\begin{steps}{The task group will deliver:}
\item A specification for a machine-readable format for the configuration
    structure. It's intended to be easily accessible by M-mode software and
    debuggers.
\item A specification for a human-readable format for the configuration
    structure. It's intended to be used to talk about the system description in
    this document as well as other documentation, to help designers write a
    configuration structure, and to display the configuration structure to
    people.
\item A software tool that translates back and forth between the
    machine-readable and human-readable format.
\item A specification for a method to discover and access, from M-mode
    software, the machine-readable configuration structures.
\end{steps}

The configuration structure should be flexible enough that future task groups
wonâ€™t feel the need to create another structure used to describe implementation
parameters. Implementation parameters are details that a RISC-V specification
explicitly leaves up to an implementation. This includes hart-specific details
like the kinds of hardware triggers supported, as well as details that are
outside harts such as the supported abstract debug commands.

\section{Use Cases}

\subsection{External Debuggers}

When an external debugger connects to a system, it would like to discover as
much as possible about that system in as little time as possible. Some of this
is merely to show the user (e.g. a manufacturer name), while other features are
critical to the user (e.g. XLEN), and other features determine what kind of
operations the user can perform (e.g. supported hardware trigger types). Most
of these are already discoverable, although many require writing a value and
checking the result to see whether support exists.

Any structure that's accessible from M-mode software will already be
accessible by the debugger. There might be a structure embedded in the Debug
Module itself which is only accessible by the debugger.

The debug feature that is most complex to describe is hardware triggers. Each
hart may have billions of triggers (although 4 is more typical). Each of those
triggers can be one of 4 types, and each type has its own options. Options
are things like trigger on execute/load/store, in M/S/U mode, chain to other
trigger, exact/greater/less-than value match, etc. It's permissible for
features to be implemented, but not in all combinations. E.g. greater value
might work in combination with load/store, but not together with executed.
Each trigger is configured by writing an XLEN-bit register.

A simple way to represent this information, without worrying about every
option individually, is to think of each trigger as its numeric value. Many
values can be compactly described by a list of value/mask tuples, low/high
tuples, or low/high/mask triples. Most implementations can get away with just
one or two tuples/triples. The alternative is to have some language that
describes logical expressions which feels much more complex.

It will be common for some or all triggers to support the same set of
features, so it's important to be able to group them together. Furthermore,
it will be common for multiple harts to support the same set of triggers. We
should be able to combine the trigger information between them, assuming
there is one structure that describes multiple harts. Putting that all
together, here's an example of what we'd want to describe:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hart 0 triggers:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Triggers 0--3:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item triple of LOW, HIGH, MASK
                    \end{itemize}
              \item Trigger 4:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item tuple of VALUE0, MASK0
                        \item tuple of VALUE1, MASK1
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
    \item Hart 1--4 triggers:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Triggers 0--1:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item triple of VALUE0, MASK0
                        \item triple of VALUE1, MASK0
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In addition there are abstract commands, which have similar issues. There are
a few commands, with a number of options. Tuples/triples as described above
would work. An example description might be:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Debug Module Abstract Commands
          \begin{itemize}
              \item triple of LOW, HIGH, MASK
              \item tuple of VALUE0, MASK0
              \item tuple of VALUE1, MASK1
              \item \dots
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Firmware}

Typical system firmware is executed when the system is powered on. It
initializes hardware, and builds up firmware services or data structures for
booting up system to OS. Examples are uboot for embedded systems, and BIOS for
PCs.

Through a combination of checking CSRs and
accessing the system description (Section~\ref{sec:AccessMethod}), firmware
can programmatically determine the hardware capabilities and configure hardware
accordingly.  These hardware capabilities can include availability and
implemented features of Physical Memory Protection (PMP), Core Local Interrupt
Controller (CLIC), Core Local Interruptor (CLINT), memory map, Platform-Level
Interrupt Controller (PLIC), Real Time Clock (RTC), reset mechanism, and any
future optional core features.

The Configuration Structure is an efficient alternative to testing for specific
hardware features (including handling failures) or customizing system firmware
for the specific system it will run on.

Often system firmware will take the information it has learned from the system
description as well as through other methods, and encode it into a different
industry-standard data structure (like Devicetree).  This structure is then
passed to the subsequent boot process.

\chapter{Machine-Readable Format}

\begin{steps}{Ideas:}
\item Fully custom, along the lines of
    \url{https://github.com/riscv/riscv-debug-spec/pull/450/files#diff-9cee87c1f0feb10d9e3e9b2bfad92985R380}

\chapter{Human-Readable Format}

\begin{steps}{Ideas:}
\item Take the binary format, and expand constants to strings, add whitespace,
keeping the mapping as close to 1:1 as possible.
\item XML
\item JSON
\item ...
\end{steps}

\chapter{Access Method}
\label{sec:AccessMethod}

\begin{steps}{Ideas:}
\item A CSR contains the base address of where the structure can be accessed on
the system bus
\item A CSR address/data pair can be used to access the structure. (Write index
to the address CSR, then read from the data CSR.)
\item ...
\end{steps}
